This thesis focuses on identifying fake health news in Estonian news articles by leveraging a pre-labelled dataset in another language. The primary objective is to develop a reliable system for generating ground truth labels for fake health news in Estonian, contributing to the broader field of fake news detection. The proposed approach employs a hybrid two-phase methodology involving semantic similarity measurements, manual annotation, classification, and confidence sampling to create a novel fake health news dataset in Estonian.
